                    <!-- <strong> -->
                    This paper presents DreamLLM, a learning framework that first achieves versatile Multimodal Large
                    Language Models (MLLMs) empowered with frequently overlooked synergy between multimodal comprehension
                    and creation. DreamLLM operates on two fundamental principles. The first focuses on the generative
                    modeling of both language and image posteriors by direct sampling in the raw multimodal space. This
                    approach circumvents the limitations and information loss inherent to external feature extractors
                    like CLIP, and a more thorough multimodal understanding is obtained. Second, DreamLLM fosters the
                    generation of raw, interleaved documents, modeling both text and image contents, along with
                    unstructured layouts. This allows DreamLLM to learn all conditional, marginal, and joint multimodal
                    distributions effectively. As a result, DreamLLM is the first MLLM capable of generating free-form
                    interleaved content. Comprehensive experiments highlight DreamLLM's superior performance as a
                    zero-shot multimodal generalist, reaping from the enhanced learning synergy.

                            drama film directed by Francis Ford Coppola. It is the first installment in The Godfather
                            trilogy, which also includes The Godfather Part II (1974) and The Godfather Part III (1990).
                            The movie is widely regarded as a masterpiece and a milestone in the mafia genre, exploring
                            the story of the Corleone family, a fictional Italian-American crime family in New York. It
                            follows the transformation of Michael Corleone, the youngest son of the family's aging don,
                            Vito Corleone, as he rises to power and eventually takes on the mantle of his father. The
                            film features a strong cast, which includes Marlon Brando as Vito Corleone, Al Pacino as
                            Michael Corleone, James Caan as Sonny Corleone, Robert Duvall as Tom Hagen, and Diane Keaton
                            as Kay Corleone. The Godfather is known for its iconic scenes, memorable lines, and its
                            impact on the Hollywood film industry.</div>

                            difference in the style of the word and the background suggests that each photograph

                            on various topics such as science, physics, and their respective sports. Here is a possible
                            dialogue script:<br><br>Einstein: Good afternoon, Mr. Messi. How are you?
                            <br><br>Messi: Hello, Dr. Einstein. I am doing well. Thank you for having me.
                            <br><br>Einstein: I am pleased to encounter a fellow genius in the world of sports, and I
                            would love to hear your insights on the game.
                            <br><br>Messi: Thank you, sir. As a soccer player, I feel that the key to success is having
                            a strong mindset, an understanding of the game, and the ability to adapt to different
                            situations. I try to learn from each game and work on my weaknesses.
                            <br><br>Einstein: Indeed, I have said similar things about the nature of intelligence and
                            knowledge. Learning from past experiences is crucial to personal growth and understanding.
                            It reminds me of a famous quote by the German philosopher Johann Gottlieb Fichte: “If you
                            would be a genius, think deeply and long, and incessantly about one thing. ”
                            <br><br>Messi: I understand the value of continuous learning, and I try to apply it in my
                            training and on the field. I am always trying to improve my skills and learn from my
                            colleagues in the club.
                            <br><br>Einstein: That is a wonderful attitude to have. I am also very impressed by your
                            passion for the field. In my opinion, passion is an integral part of success. It fuels the
                            drive to achieve greatness, and it is especially evident in my own field of physics. For
                            instance, I once said, “The passion for truth is the foundation for the sciences.”
                            <br><br>Messi: It is a great feeling to know that I am playing a sport that is full of
                            passionate individuals. I am proud to be a part of that world and do my part in contributing
                            to it.
                            <br><br>Einstein: I am sure that you, Mr. Messi, would agree that having a passion for
                            knowledge can lead to discoveries that change the world. For example, my theory of
                            relativity has had a profound impact on our understanding of space, time, and gravity. It
                            was a result of decades of contemplation and research.
                            <br><br>Messi: The world of sports and the world of science are not so different when it
                            comes to the pursuit of excellence. I am honored to be in the presence of a true genius like
                            you, Dr. Einstein.
                            <br><br>Einstein: I feel the same way, and I would like to thank you for this opportunity to
                            engage in a conversation about our respective fields. The world is a wondrous place, and I
                            am grateful to be a part of it.

                        <div class="message-text">This image is funny for a few reasons. First, the brown teddy bear is
                            in a swimming pool, which is an unexpected and unusual environment for a stuffed bear.
                            Typically, teddy bears are found indoors, in a child's room or on a couch. Swimming pools
                            are associated with human activities, so seeing a teddy bear in a pool evokes a sense of
                            humor, as it's an amusing juxtaposition of the bear's typically inanimate and non-aquatic
                            nature with the human-centered environment of a pool. Second, the bear is holding up one of
                            its hands, which could be interpreted as a gesture of surprise or even as an attempt to save
                            itself from drowning, adding to the humor. Lastly, the fact that the bear is swimming with a
                            smile on its face, as if it is enjoying itself, further contributes to the amusing nature of
                            the scene. The combination of the unfamiliar environment and the bear's expressions create a
                            funny and entertaining image.</div>

                            swimming? Discuss what will happen if teddy bears can swim. Include some high-quality

                        <div class="message-text">If teddy bears can swim, it's likely that they would try to mimic
                            human behavior in the water. They would likely float on their backs, kick their legs, and
                            even hold their breath underwater. Of course, it's impossible to know for certain what teddy
                            bears would do in such a situation, but that doesn't mean you shouldn't imagine! Imagine a
                            scene with a teddy bear floating in a pool, wearing a cap and goggles, and laughing with
                            delight as it floats on its back in the water. Imagine the scene with a lemon drop pool
                            float and a swim cap on a teddy bear and it would be even more adorable. In the image,
                            you'll see a brown teddy bear wearing a swim cap, floating on its back in a swimming pool.

                            large brown belly. This makes the bear look even more furry and cute, and even more likely
                            to make you smile.</div>

                            muscular with strong limbs, which they use for climbing, digging, and foraging for food. In

                            and there is no better place to experience than this romantic city during the holiday season.
                            The city’s historic center is surrounded by a collection of beautiful buildings on a square mile.
                            Stroll along the famous Ring Boulevard and admire the architecture.
                            Some of the buildings date back to the 13th century.
                            The Vienna State Opera House is one of the most beautiful buildings.
                            Founded in 1869, the opera house is the home of the Vienna State Opera and the annual Vienna Opera Ball.

                            A visit to the romantic Christmas Market in Vienna is also a unique experience.
